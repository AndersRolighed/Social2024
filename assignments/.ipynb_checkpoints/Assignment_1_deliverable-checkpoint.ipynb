    "\n",
    "The human eye is indeed a powerful tool for data analysis, when the data is prepared in a manner that benefits the visual encoding. If the data is not presentable the eye can't really establish a differentiation between the features in the data, that might have a significant value. This comes to show easily if the data is purely presented in a \"messy\" fashion. This is why data visualization in itself is important, to ease the beholder's understanding using just their eyes. \n",

    "One example I find easy to understand is the baseball-batter example. A player on 1 team can have a higher batting-average every year over several years, than another player, yet when looking at the total stats over those years, the second player can have an overall higher batting-average. This again just stems from the imbalance of the distribution of \"balls played\" during those years, which can then lead to the simpsons paradox.\n",

    "\n",
    "Even tough it is not entirely the same concept, I compare exploratory and explanatory data analysis to the concept of data \"exploration vs exploitation\", which is used in eg. reinforcement learning. Here it is a tradeoff of when you wish to continue exploring more about a given enviroment / dataset, or if you wish to dwelve more into and make the most of the data you currently have. Exploratory data analysis is a way of saying that you have a certain topic of interest, that you wish to uncover main aspects of a new problem, whereas explanatory data analysis aims to make you able to explain the core consequences and causes for a well-defined problem."
